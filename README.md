## Lab Files

The repo arrived with many files, and I did not use them all. I apologize for not having cleaned up the repository; hopefully that will come soon! Along with, er, integrating the addenda into the actual labs, or adjusting how they parcel out their components across assignments. 

For now, I can say that I assigned the following labs in my Writing with Data course in fall of 2021, and **I recommend visitors work through the labs in this order.** For best results, download and open in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
* [lab2 - intro to R](lab2%20-%20intro%20to%20R.Rmd)
* [lab3 - data cleaning and exploration](lab3%20-%20data%20cleaning%20and%20exploration.Rmd)
* [lab3a - data cleaning addendum](lab3a--data-cleaning-addendum.Rmd)
* [lab4 - data exploration part 2](lab4%20-%20data%20exploration%20part%202.Rmd)
* [lab4a - complex merge (county level data)](lab4a%20-%20complex%20merge%20(county%20level%20data).Rmd)
