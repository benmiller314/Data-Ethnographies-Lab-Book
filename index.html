    <h2>Prof. Lindsay Poirier</h2>
    <h3>For the next few months, I will be working on re-designing these lab books. Below I provide an outline of some of the introductory labs.</h3>

  <div class ="container">
    <h3><a href = "lab1.nb.html">Lab 1</a></h3>
    <p>In lab 1, we go over some of the basics of working in RStudio, writing in RMarkdown, and working in R. We also discuss why we may want to conduct data ethnographies.</p>
    <h3><a href = "lab2.nb.html">Lab 2</a></h3>
    <p>In lab 2, we begin to map out a research plan, anticipate some of the social, political, and economic contexts our research topics are embedded within, and begin to search for relevant public data.</p>
    <h3><a href = "lab3.nb.html">Lab 3</a></h3>
    <p>In lab 3, we examine data documentation and other sources where a dataset is cited to unpack how the dataset was produced and what it was designed to represent.</p>
    <h3><a href = "lab4.nb.html">Lab 4</a></h3>
    <p>In lab 4, we learn how to import data into R and how to clean data for analysis. We then explore the data, documenting its structure, its observational unit, how values are categorized, and why there may be missing values.</p>
